      *tilt* is a database designed to provide detailed insights into firms,
      primarily focusing on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It offers
      extensive information on their climate profiles and transition risks
      associated with evolving environmental standards. Recognising that the
      creation of climate data involves a series of crucial decisions that
      significantly influence outcomes, *tilt* aims to empower its users to
      independently take these decisions. It allows them to thoughtfully consider
      these decisions and customise methodological choices to best suit their
      specific needs.
